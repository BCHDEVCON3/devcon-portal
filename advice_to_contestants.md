# Advice to contestants

Hackathons are a lot like marathons. People go to marathons for many different reasons. Some people go because they want to compete at a high level. But most of us take part because we want to improve ourselves, make friends, and have fun.

As most hackers go to hackathons primarily for learning and meeting friends, the competition aspect should be fun, friendly, and promote learning. To make sure you foster a fun and cooperative environment, rather than an overly competitive one, you should be open to helping others in chat or asking for help. People are excited to attend this event because it will be a great environment for learning, networking, and making friends, with prizes as an added bonus. 

Since projects are voted upon by other teams you may want to describe bits of your work in the chat as the hackathon progresses so people have some understanding of what you are trying to accomplish and are more likely to vote for your project. Also, it makes more sense to publish to your teams GitHub repository more often than not to show how the project evolves.
