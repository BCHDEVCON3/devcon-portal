# Hackathon Rules

## Advice to organizers on making a fair competition

Hackers go to hackathons primarily for learning and meeting friends, so the competition aspect should be fun, friendly, and promote learning. To make sure you foster a fun and cooperative environment, rather than an overly competitive one, you should not have large cash prizes or prizes of an extremely high value. You should make sure to emphasise the importance of learning, teaching, and cooperating in your opening talks, workshops, and website copy. Do not over-emphasise competition or prizes on your website. People will be excited to attend your event because it will be a great environment for learning and making friends - prizes are an added bonus, not the be-all and end-all.

Consider having prizes for the best newcomers, best 



## The spirit of the competition

Hackathons are primarily about learning, sharing, and having fun. The competition is an added bonus of the event, not the be-all and end-all. So teams should communicate, be friendly to each other, and work together. You'll get a lot more from the event by working with other teams than by trying to work against them. Teams are encouraged to offer help and advice to each other. 

Sharing is a big part of the _Hacker Spirit_. Refusing to help another team because of competition is not in the spirit of hackathons and is bad sportsmanship. You shouldn’t be afraid to share your ideas with other teams. Great ideas are built on collaboration and sharing, not secrecy and protectiveness. Teams should respect each others’ ideas and not copy each other. You are not judged on ideas anyway.

Another big part of the _Hacker Spirit_ is building. You should endeavour to build something at the event. Hackathons are about building, not about pitching a business idea. Demos of working applications are encouraged and pitches or presentations are discouraged. If you weren't able to finish a working demo, that's fine! Show us what you managed to get built, and tell us what you learned! What matters is that you attempted to build something--that's the true _Hacker Spirit_!

The last part of the _Hacker Spirit_ is about learning and teaching. Offer help and constructive feedback when you can. But be sure not to be condescending. For example, do not "feign surprise" ("OMG how can you not know what Node.js is!?") but introduce people to things they may not know.

Remember, asking for help is okay! Everybody at the hackathon should be happy to help you! If you're not comfortable asking for help from another hacker, feel free to ask an organizer, mentor, or sponsor--they'll be delighted to help! Getting help on your hack won't make you lose points, it's what you're meant to do!

## The rules of the competition

- Teams should be a maximum of four people who are present at the event.
- Teams should not begin work on their project before the hackathon. 
- Teams can use an idea they had before the event.
- Teams can work on ideas that have already been done. Hacks do not have to be “innovative”. If somebody wants to make a bill splitting app (a very common idea) they should be allowed to do so and should be judged on the quality of their hack. These days it’s hard to find something that’s fully original and they might not know it has been done before anyway.
- Teams can work on an idea that they have worked on before. As long as they do not re-use code, it is fine to work on an idea t
- Teams must stop hacking once the time is up
- However, teams are allowed to debug and make small fixes to their programs after time is up. Fixing small problems that arise is okay. e.g. you present something on stage and your server crashes because x, you can fix x then present.
- Teams should present a demo of what they have built. Pitches or presentations are discouraged.
- Teams should present what they have done even if their hack is broken or they weren’t able to finish what they made
