# Hackathon Rules

Advice to organizers on making a fair competition

You should not have large cash prizes or prizes of an extremely high value
We don’t want an over competitive environment



The spirit of the competition

Hackers go to hackathons primarily for learning and meeting friends, so the competition aspect should be fun, friendly, and promote learning.
As hackathons are about learning and sharing, teams should communicate, be friendly to each other, and work together. Teams are encouraged to offer help and advice to each other. Refusing to help another team because of competition is not the hacker spirit. Teams shouldn’t be afraid to share their ideas with others. Teams should respect each others’ ideas and not copy each other. You are not judged on ideas anyway.


The rules of the competition

Teams should be a maximum of four people at the event
Teams should not begin work on their project before the hackathon
Teams can use an idea they had before the event
Teams can work on ideas that have already been done. Hacks do not have to be “innovative”. If somebody wants to make a bill splitting app (a very common idea) they should be allowed to do so and should be judged on the quality of their hack. These days it’s hard to find something that’s fully original and they might not know it has been done before anyway.
Teams can work on an idea that they have worked on before. As long as they do not re-use code, it is fine to work on an idea
Teams must stop hacking once the time is up
However, teams are allowed to debug and make small fixes to their programs after time is up. Fixing small problems that arise is okay. e.g. you present something on stage and your server crashes because x, you can fix x then present.
Teams should present a demo of what they have built. Pitches or presentations are discouraged.
Teams should present what they have done even if their hack is broken or they weren’t able to finish what they made
