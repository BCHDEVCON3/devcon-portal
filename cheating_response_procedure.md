# SLPVH Cheating Response Procedure

The following is a guide of actions to be taken in the case of an accusation that a team cheated or otherwise violated the rules of competition.
Accusations of cheating may include but are not limited to:

- A team using somebody elseâ€™s code
- A team misrepresenting the work they did
- A team having too many team members
- A team using code that was written outside the event

## Document the Report

Try to get as much of the allegation in written form by the reporter. The important information to gather include the following:

- Identifying information (name, email, phone, etc.) of the reporter
- Identifying information (name, email, phone, etc.) of the participant/team accused of cheating
- Reason the reporter suspects cheating
- Other people suspected to be involved in the cheating
- Other witnesses / people who suspect the cheating
- Any relevant URLs (e.g. for GitHub repos or Devpost pages)

The SLPVH Team will investigate the allegation by reviewing public materials about the hack, including project repos, project submissions, and anything else available to them.

## Response

### Cheating Did Not Occur

If SLPVH determines cheating did not occur, we will state so in chat.

### Other Outcomes

If SLPVH is unable to determine that cheating did not occur based on publicly available resources, SLPVH will then communicate with the alleged cheater. Informing them of what has been reported about them.
Allow the alleged cheater to give their side of the story to the staff. After this point, if the report stands, let the alleged cheater know what actions will be taken against them.

Some actions for the staff to consider when dealing with alleged cheating offenders:

- Warning the cheater to cease their behavior and that any further reports will result in sanctions
- Not allowing the participants to demo
- Not allowing the participants to win prizes
- Revocation of prizes & recognitions
- Banning the participants from future events (either indefinitely or for a certain time period)
- Publishing an account of the cheating

Depending on the cheating allegation, SLPVH may decide to make one or more public announcements. If necessary, this will be done with a short announcement. No one other than SLPVH or someone delegated authority from SLPVH should make any announcements.
