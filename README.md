# Hackathon Rules

These are standard competition rules used at MLH Member Hackathons. Not all MLH Member Hackathons will use these rules as organizers can choose to use these or their own rules. Organizers can use these rules exactly or fork them and edit them to suit their needs. If you have a suggestion for these rules or a question about them, please submit an issue [here](https://github.com/MLH/hackathon-rules/issues).

There are several documents in the _Hackathon Rules_:

- [Advice to Organizers](Advice to Organizers.md): A few tips for organizers on how to make sure they create a fun and fair competition.
- [Rules](Rules.md): The list of rules participants must follow and the judging criteria.
- [Cheating Response Procedure](Cheating Response Procedure.md): How people can report violations of the rules and how those reports will be dealt with.
