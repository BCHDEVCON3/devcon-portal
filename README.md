# SLPVH Hackathon Rules

These are standard competition rules used at MLH Member Hackathons, modified for our use with SLPVH. 

There are several documents in the _Hackathon Rules_:

- [Advice to Contestants](advice_to_contestants.md): A few tips for contestants on how to make sure they have fun.
- [Rules](rules.md): The list of rules participants must follow and the judging criteria.
- [Cheating Response Procedure](cheating_response_procedure.md): How people can report violations of the rules and how those reports will be dealt with.
