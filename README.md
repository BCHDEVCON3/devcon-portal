# Bitcoin Cash DevCon III Hackathon Rules

These are standard competition rules used at MLH Member Hackathons as well as last year's SLPVH hackathon, and modified for our use with BCH DevCon. 

There are several documents in the _Hackathon Rules_:

- [Advice to Contestants](advice_to_contestants.md): A few tips for contestants on how to make sure they have fun.
- [Rules](rules.md): The list of rules participants must follow and the judging criteria.
- [Cheating Response Procedure](cheating_response_procedure.md): How people can report violations of the rules and how those reports will be dealt with.
